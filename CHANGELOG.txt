Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-03
-----------------------
- Issue #1856998: converted the 'Thank you for voting' and 'You have abstained'
  messages into default Rules.
- Issue #1841644 - added 'Elected' and 'Defeated' as candidate statuses. They
  have no special meaning or effect, yet.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-09-05
-----------------------
- Added a 'candidate types' admin system. You will need to run database updates
  (API change).
- The above means that nomination forms are now per post, not per election (UI
  change).
- Removed the 'phone' column from the election_candidate table, adding a default
  Field instead.
