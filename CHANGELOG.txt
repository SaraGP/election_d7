Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-27
-----------------------
- API change: removed 'save votes' callbacks, replacing them with a new hook,
  hook_election_vote_ELECTION_TYPE_save(). See election_vote.api.php.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-24
-----------------------
- Many changes to theme-related things such as render arrays, theme functions,
  and some string changes and CSS tweaks.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2013-01-17
-----------------------
- Removed Views field handler linking elections to their candidates tab.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-26
-----------------------
- New submodule: election_export, which takes over the ballot file (.blt) export
  functionality which used to live in the election_stv submodule.
- API change: hook_election_type_info() used to ask for 'results download form'
  which is now no longer used. The key 'export' (Boolean) now defines whether
  results can be exported & downloaded. This requires the election_export module
  to be enabled, and the election type needs to support candidates. See
  election.api.php.
- API change: hook_election_type_info() used to ask for 'results page' which is
  now no longer used. To change the results page, modules should implement
  hook_election_results_page_alter(&$output, $post, $totals). But this will soon
  be replaced by a theme preprocess hook.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-16
-----------------------
- Default stats groups in theme_election_statistics() are now arrays, not
  stdClass objects. See election_statistics_get_totals().

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-05
-----------------------
- Changed the default name of referendum posts from 'motions' to 'questions'.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-12-03
-----------------------
- Issue #1856998: converted the 'Thank you for voting' and 'You have abstained'
  messages into default Rules.
- Issue #1841644 - added 'Elected' and 'Defeated' as candidate statuses. They
  have no special meaning or effect, yet.

Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-09-05
-----------------------
- Added a 'candidate types' admin system. You will need to run database updates
  (API change).
- The above means that nomination forms are now per post, not per election (UI
  change).
- Removed the 'phone' column from the election_candidate table, adding a default
  Field instead.
