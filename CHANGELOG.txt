Election 7.x-1.x-dev, 2012-09-05
-----------------------
- Added a 'candidate types' admin system. You will need to run database updates
  (API change).
- The above means that nomination forms are now per post, not per election (UI
  change).
- Removed the 'phone' column from the election_candidate table, adding a default
  Field instead.
